  faqs:
    - question: What is a hackathon?
      answer: A hackathon is a gathering where people collaboratively build a
        project from the ground-up over a short period of time. While
        working on a particular project, the idea is for each group
        member to have the ability and freedom to work on whatever they
        want.
    - question: Is it free?
      answer: YES! There is no fee associated with H.A.R.D. Hack. In fact,
        there will be food, water, and hardware provided at the
        hackathon. Just make sure to bring yourself! (And check out the
        next question to find out what's suggested to bring.)
    - question: What do I bring?
      answer: These are some highly suggested items to bring-- <b>laptop</b>,
        blanket, <b>resuable water bottle</b>, layers of clothing,
        <b>comfortable clothes/shoes</b>, change of clothes, toothbrush,
        deodorant, energy drinks, extra snacks, and any hardware you
        wish to use.
    - question: Do I need a team?
      answer: Teams are up to 5 people, so feel free to work by yourself, in a
        pair, or with a full team of 5! However, it is recommended to
        form a team of 5 just because it's you and 4 other people
        working on one project versus just yourself.

    - question: When is it?
